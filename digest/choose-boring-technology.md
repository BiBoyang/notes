It's really worthwhile to natually write down what all of the awkward things you'd have to do are. A lot of the time when you do this, you realize that the situation isn't really that bad. Or it may be bad, but not as bad as the task of operationalizing a new thing.

But it can go the other way, too. You can list all of the unnatual costs and conclude that adding a new thing will be worth it.
